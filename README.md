## Challenge Overview

- Remove the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School and keep all other data associated with ninth-grade students and Thomas School intact.
- After removal of the data:
- Recalculate the district summary and answer how the district summary was affected.
 - Recalculate summary for each district school and answer how the school summary was affected.
 - Recalculate the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.
 - Recalculate the average math score received by students in each grade level at each school. Recalculate the average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
 - How does removing the ninth gradersâ€™ math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance, relative to the other schools?
 - Recalculate the school performance based on the spending per student, the size of the school and the type of the school. 
 - How does removing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, Scores by School Type?
